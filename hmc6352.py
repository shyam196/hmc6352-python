    Class for an HMC6352 digital compass

    Simple functionality -- does not implement anything except getting a heading from the device
    except in "standby" mode (see datasheet -- this is the default mode of the device)

    Tested with Python 3.5

    Example usage:

    >>> bus = smbus.SMBus(1)
    >>> compass = HMC6352(0x21, bus)
    >>> print(compass.heading)

        :param address: The i2c address of the device (use `i2cdetect` on command line)
        :param bus: An instance of smbus.SMBus
